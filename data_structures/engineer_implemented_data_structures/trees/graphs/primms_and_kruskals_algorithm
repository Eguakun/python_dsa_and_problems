#djisktras algorithm  is primarily used for directed and weighted graphs, problems where you find shortest lowest cost path from starting vertex to destination vertex 

#djisktras fails on graphs with negative edges 

# use floyd warshall for negative edges graphs 

#primms algorithm is primarily used for undirected weighted graphs to find the lowest cost path to connect all vertices in the graph 

# How to approach all pair shortest path problems:
# - Sparse Graph with Negative Edge Weights - O(V^2logV): Johnson's Algo
# - Sparse graph with no negative Weights - O(V^2logV): Dijskstra's Algo
# - Dense Graphs- O(V^2): Floyd Warshall
